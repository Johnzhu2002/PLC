Microcontroller and PLC Application Learning Project
Welcome to my GitHub repository! This is a collection of practical projects where I learn and master the applications of various microcontrollers (such as Arduino, STM32, etc.) and PLCs (Programmable Logic Controllers). My goal is to explore the use of these technologies in fields like smart lighting, smart agriculture, and smart home automation.

Project Goals
Learn the Basics of Microcontrollers and PLCs: Gain hands-on experience with programming and applying microcontrollers and PLCs.

Explore Smart Applications: Investigate practical applications of microcontrollers and PLCs in smart lighting, smart agriculture, and smart home automation.

Share and Collaborate: Share my learning outcomes with the community through open-source projects and exchange experiences with other developers.

Project Content
Smart Lighting: Use microcontrollers to control the brightness, color, and switching of LED lights, implementing an automated lighting system.

Smart Agriculture: Utilize sensors and microcontrollers to monitor soil moisture, temperature, and light, automating the irrigation system.

Smart Home: Combine microcontrollers with PLCs to implement home automation systems, such as smart locks and temperature control systems.
